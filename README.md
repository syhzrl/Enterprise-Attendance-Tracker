# Enterprise-Attendance-Tracker

Enterprise Attendance Tracker is an automated program that provides accurate charge calculation by tracking and processing customers attendance data.
It works by first extracting attendance data from a software called MicroEngine. This data extraction utilizes a RPA called TagUi to automate the data
extraction process. Then, TagUi will upload the relevant data into a specified Google Sheet where the majority of data processing and calculation will
be done. This process is done daily and by the end of the month a summary will be produced and customers involved will recieved an automated summary email.
This program is 100% automated.
